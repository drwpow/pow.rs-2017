been about a year since Chris Coyier’s post The Great Divide came out. The\n“divide,” of course, being between 2 armies within front-end development that had been forming:\n\nOn one side, an army of developers whose interests, responsibilities, and skill sets are heavily\nrevolved around JavaScript. On the other, an army of developers whose interests, responsibilities,\nand skill sets are focused on other areas of the front end, like HTML, CSS, design, interaction,\npatterns, accessibility, etc.\n\nIf you‘re unfamiliar with what he’s talking about, I’d read that post, but a quick-and-dirty history\nof front-end is that it’s a profession that was once a league of ex-designers muddling their way\nthrough code, that’s recently transformed into a proper programming discipline (with some design\nskills remaining a part of the job requirement). Chris’ post is somewhat of a flag post marking that\nslow, subtle shift that had been happening in the profession for years.\nMy initial reaction to this was to reject it—not that the divide wasn‘t happening, but the idea that\nthese should be 2 different professions. To be blunt, I saw it as someone who made their career on\nCSS attacking the good work that JavaScript folks had been doing because it threatened his career (I\nsay that as someone respects Chris immensely, but people are allowed to be wrong in blog posts). I\neven wrote an earlier draft of this post arguing that there’s no divide; that’s just how front-end\nis now. Get used to it. Git gud.\nI now don’t see it that way, and I think Chris (rightly) was just pointing out a concern that he had\nabout this divide forming.\nAs a result, I began to recognize my own limitations. I saw myself as someone that was good at both\nCSS and JS. But if I’m being honest, I’m not that good at CSS; I just am good enough at design\nwhere it seems like I am. I’m also not that good at JS, as someone without a Computer Science\nbackground, I am not the master architect that well-educated CS students tend to be (to be clear—I’m\nstrongly in the “you don’t need a degree to be a dev” camp as a member myself, but there is\nnonetheless a value in a CS education that I do not possess).\nIn short, the past couple months have been me coming to terms with not being able to do it all. And\ndo it all well.\nBut all that musing aside, the core content of this blog post hasn’t changed, because it was drafted\nfrom notes I wrote to a coworker wanting to learn more about front-end, and as I was ennumerating\nall there is to learn today I noticed the knowledge started to pool into 3 rough areas of expertise,\nwhich I still stand by. Will these become 3 different jobs eventually? I don’t know. The older I\nget the less I’m sure of. But I do know that each of these groups are substantial learning efforts\neach their own, and I do now think it’s impossible to master all three of them.\nTreat this like a DnD skill tree or something—up to you to spread points evenly or be a glass cannon\nin one.\n🔗👨‍🎨 I. Browser APIs &amp; Rendering (HTML/CSS)\nThe area of expertise of Browser APIs &amp; Rendering revolves around two central questions: On the\nweb, how do I make things look like things? and How does a browser work to help me accomplish\nthis?\nAt beginner levels, browser rendering involves understanding the fundamentals of HTML &amp; CSS to get\ncode to look like a design. At intermediate levels, this gets into animations, render profiling, and\nmaking interactive things perform adequately in a browser environment. At the highest levels,\nmastery of browser rendering means being able to describe in great detail how assets are requested\nand the priority of their loading, the browser paint API, and how to render anything—even 3D—at 60\nframes per second (the maximum a browser will allow).\nFor the traditional CS student, the browser is something that often gets underestimated. This\nresults in the common “I don’t understand CSS” state of confusion that so many backend developers\nfind themselves in. And it is confusing, until you treat the browser as the special, weird runtime\nenvironment that it is. Often times it’s what you’re fighting with here—your own misconceptions of\nwhat the browser is doing.\nTake the following with a grain of salt, but here is roughly how you might track growth of your\nknowledge in this area:\n🔗Beginner\nSkillExample\nFundamentals of HTMLI understand what different HTML tags do\nFundamentals of CSSI understand how to use &amp; apply CSS to HTML to style pages\nFundamentals of Browser ResourcesI understand where to put CSS &amp; JS files and reference them in the HTML for them to show up\n\n🔗Intermediate\nSkillExample\nAccessibilityI can ensure sites are usable for people that use screen readers and other assistive technologies\nAnimationsI can animate objects using either CSS or a JavaScript framework like Three.js\nHardware accelerationI understand certain properties &amp; animations can use the GPU for performance\nRender profiling²I can use tools like Lighthouse to understand what is slowing down browser rendering &amp; performance\nImage formatsI understand when to use each image format (JPG, PNG, WebP, …), and how to optimize them\nCommon Browser API knowledgeI understand common browser APIs like fetch and history, and know when to leverage the browser and when to write my own JavaScript\n\n🔗Master\nSkillExample\nResource prioritization² ³I understand resource prioritization and the steps from streaming initial HTML payload, to fetching the resources, to rendering them in priority order\nRender debugging²I understand how the browser performs paint operations and how to optimize them\nComprehensive Browser API Knowledge²I understand more invisible APIs like WebGL, Paint, and the DOM and understand how they differ or can work in sync to render parts of a page\nBrowser processesI understand the Browser, Renderer, and GPU processes that lie underneath the higher-level APIs\n\n² related to II / ³ related to II\nYou may find that much of the “CSS Dev” from the Great Divide post fits in here, with the addition\nof JavaScript like fetch and history, and the omission of CSS frameworks like SMACSS.\nSo already we’re breaking up that division! As for CSS framework knowledge, that fits more neatly\nin…\n🔗👩‍🔬 II. JS Programming &amp; Architecture\nThe knowledge of JavaScript &amp; Architecture is the recent development of front-end into a more\nformal, proper software environment from web dev’s laissez-faire “just throw that code anywhere”\nbeginnings. This roughly correlates with the JavaScript-oriented type in Chris’ post somewhat, and\nis closer to the comfort sphere of a traditional Computer Science education. Whereas Camp 1 trends\ntoward static display, Camp 2 adds dynamism, automation, and interaction. You could even call this\n“the backend of front-end.”\nThis area of knowledge is concerned with How should this application be interacted with? and\nHow should code for the front-end be organized for delivery and team maintainability? The\npursuit of these 2 questions, together, have led to many milestones such as that React thing you’ve\nheard so much about (along with Node.js, which we’ll cover more in the last section).\nThough JavaScript is one of the most popular programming ecosystems, it’s still developing. And for\nthat reason I don’t feel comfortable dividing intermediate- and master-level topics. Everyone’s\njourney through here will differ, and for that reason, I only distinguish between basics and\nnon-basics.\nIn your rebuttal of this blog post, please be gentle with this section ;)\n🔗Beginner\nSkillExample\nFundamentals of JavaScriptI can build basic things with vanilla&nbsp;JS and don’t always need a library (only sometimes)\nJavaScript quirksI understand the basics of working with objects in JS, the basics of this, and a rough understanding of scopes\nAsync knowledgeI understand the basics of Promise() and can write code to fetch remote data (AJAX) or deal with async operations\nFundamentals of Frameworks³I understand how to spin up a React / Vue / Svelte / whatever project and get something visible\nFundamentals of CSS organization¹I have some basic strategies to organize styles, whether that’s a methodology like SMACSS or a utility like Tailwind\n\n🔗Intermediate/Master\nSkillExample\nComprehensive JS knowledge³I can solve any common problem in JS (when sensible), and I possess up-to-date knowledge of the latest ECMAScript 20xx features\nFront-end philosophyI have cursory-to-advanced knowledge of how strategies like State Machines, Observables, Component-based architecture, etc. solve different problems for building web applications\nPerformance profilingI understand how to profile JavaScript’s performance, even moving operations off the main thread where needed\nInheritance and prototypesBeyond data types, I understand JavaScript’s prototypal inheritance design\nType SystemI understand JavaScript’s type system and coercion, and know how best to leverage it (and potentially possess TypeScript knowledge)\nTestingI ensure all JavaScript is tested, whether with unit / E2E tests, headless browser tests, or VRT\nAdvanced network knowledge¹I have comprehensive strategies for consuming API data and feel comfortable using client like Apollo or rolling my own.\nDOM manipulation¹I understand JavaScript’s role in DOM manipulation, and strategies for managing this such as React (related to Camp 1)\nWebAssemblyI understand how JavaScript interops with WebAssembly and know when to leverage it\n\n¹ related to I / ³ related to III\nIn JavaScript’s strange, strange development, something very weird happened that few could have\npredicted: JavaScript turned into a backend language with Node.js. This not only changed how we\nprepared JavaScript for the browser (Camp 1); it also changed how we wrote it (Camp 2).\nLet’s be clear: Node.js is a backend language. In this post we’re not talking about the backend,\nbut we can’t deny that Node.js has changed the front-end ecosystem forever with advanced tooling to\nnpm. And this knowledge makes up the final area.\n🔗👷‍♀️ III: The Toolchain (Node.js, npm, Babel, bundlers)\nThe final area of expertise is one you won’t see outlined often, if at all, as separate from JS\n(II). It likely got lumped in with the “JS devs”&nbsp;in The Great Divide post. Though it seems like a\npart of JS, the toolchain is more “meta”, and its concern more aligns with: Can the way we develop\nweb applications be improved? and it’s given rise to module systems, package\nmanagers, transpilers, bundlers, and even new languages.\nSo while web dev today is largely JS, thus explaining the confusion between II and III, perhaps it\nwon’t be for long with things like WebAssembly on the rise. And you can contribute to the\ntoolchain without being a JS dev whatsoever (for example, though Babel is central to JS dev these\ndays, Babel plugins themselves apply generic principles of ASTs that apply to any language,\nand nothing about it is uniquely JS other than the syntax used to write it).\nThis area of knowledge is also hard to outline because by its nature it questions the ontology of\nfront-end development. But it’s also the most powerful because it has the ability to transform how\nwe work. And as it also requires at least an intermediate understanding of some programming\nlanguage (even if not JS), the “Beginner” section was omitted entirely here.\n🔗Intermediate\nSkillExample\nConfigurationI can configure a local development without a boilerplate, working directly with tools like Gulp, webpack, and Parcel\nTranspilation¹I can configure Babel and PostCSS to transpile code for specific targets\nBundling &amp; optimization²I can set up build pipelines to ship production-ready code and optimize delivery of those bundles\nAdvanced npmI’ve deployed my own packages to npm\n\n🔗Master\nSkillExample\nArchitectI can build front-end boilerplates for other people to use\nAST understandingI can create my own Babel or ESLint plugins\nBundler understandingI can create my own webpack plugins\nCode GenerationI can generate JS programatically\nCI²I create automated pipelines for deploying npm packages as well as shipping optimized bundles to production\nEcosystem understandingI understand how to deploy npm packages for Node.js, web browsers, and CLI tools, and how to target each\n\n¹ related to I / ² related to II\nUsually when complaints arise about the state of front-end development, whether that’s how much it’s\nchanged, or if it’s too complicated, usually JavaScript gets the blame when really it’s the\ntoolchain. Of course, this is confusing, since JavaScript is both the engine that runs the toolchain\n(Node.js) and the input/output of the toolchain itself (browser JS).\nThis is also the area of expertise that’s undergone the biggest changes of front-end development,\nand it won’t be settling any time soon. Still, now’s the perfect time to jump in and contribute\nbecause all these things aren’t settled yet.\n🔗A final note on mastery\nRecently, a coworker used the term “Platypus” to refer to an engineering problem which is difficult\nto classify (obviously based off an animal that lays eggs, is aquatic, has fur, and poison), and I\nlove that. He didn’t remember the origin (and I Googling it only gave me the results you might\nexpect), so I apologize for not being able to source this (if you know where this originates from\nplease contact me).\nIn a similar vein, you probably you noticed the superscript ¹s, ²s, and ³s linking skills in one\narea to another. This is a natural failing of any taxonomic system to be perfect. While there’s\nalways overlap, there’s still enough net value to drawing lines that it’s worth doing.\nMastery of any of these areas is a slippery thing, too. I’m reminded of Matt Might’s post, The\nillustrated guide to a Ph.D. To merely reach the limits of human knowledge is not enough;\nwe’re all pushing to try and make that little “dent” in the shape of what’s possible. And with that\nact, we leave behind a bigger world to explore for the next generation.\nEven theoretically if you could master something, it would only last for a short time until someone\ncame along and changed what’s possible with their dent. And I can’t say this enough: the internet\nis a fledgeling industry. We’re still figuring everything out.\nAbove all else, be kind to yourself, and pursue mastery only to the extent it’s rewarding for\nyou and others around you. And if you do write an “us vs them” post, write it with the intent of\nunifying, not dividing. God knows we have too much division going on as it is.\n","id":"https://pow.rs/blog/3-pillars-of-front-end-knowledge/","title":"the great(er) divide in front-end"},"https://pow.rs/blog/did-we-fuck-up-the-internet-pt-1/":{"body":"“Learn the fundamentals” is a common piece of advice given to beginners when starting out. And\nusually for web pages, it’s some form of “learn HTML, CSS, and JS.” Those three will never go away,\nand will outlast any flavor-of-the-month framework (but full disclosure: I actually do tell\nbeginners to learn a flavor-of-the-month framework because it’s motivating, it’s what gets them\nhired, and you can still learn the fundamentals at the same time).\nBut what if the fundamentals… aren’t so fundamental? What were to happen if the fundamentals\nchanged?\nI’ve never written a “was the internet a mistake?” blog post (it’s either a cheap laugh—“we’re\nmonkeys that tricked rocks to think; we deserve what we get! ha ha”—or a bit melodramatic). But I\nguess 2020 is the year I start.\n🔗backstory: why I’m questioning the web\nWhen I say I’m questioning the fundamentals of the web, I basically mean the HTML/CSS/JS + browsers\ncombo. Or at least this current version of it. Part 1 (this post) will outline what led to this. The\nfollowing parts will try and soothsay a little.\n🔗the Mozilla layoffs\nOur journey begins with Mozilla laying off 25% of its staff in August 2020.\nSoftware layoffs suck in general, but they really suck when they carry global impact. An extreme\n(but possible) take on the outcome is: this is the death of Firefox and MDN as we know it\n(Rust may be OK).\nIf Firefox goes, then the burden of the internet rests practically on the shoulders of Chromium (if\nyou’re reading this in the far future, remember that Microsoft recently abandoned their historic\nbrowser project in favor of Chromium).\nAt worst, such monopolistic control over the internet is so dangerous it had to be held in check by\na 2001 Supreme Court ruling. At best, the responsibility of stewarding the\ndevelopment of the entire internet is so monumental, it crushes any mere team of mortals tasked\nwith it. Either way, if Chromium is the last browser standing, it’s bad news for all.\n\nDo you think the web has almost 'priced itself out of the market' in terms of complexity if only\n1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?\nMicrosoft gave up, Mozilla will struggle as you say.\n— Mike Healey on Aug 20\n\nI guess there’s WebKit still 🤷‍♂️. Until Apple remembers they’re supposed to maintain it.\n🔗maybe JS isn’t the answer\nWe pause there, and join the developer discussion in another part of the dev sphere, where people\n(like myself) are having existential career questions. Second-guessing the modern\nweb by Tom MacWright comes to mind as a post at the center of the\ndiscussion around whether or not our current JS-heavy trajectory is healthy.\nJS has always had nay-sayers. JavaScript fatigue had been questioning this direction\nsince 2015. And there have been no shortage of the “get off my lawn“ old guard complaining about any\nattempt at replacing jQuery (link). However, MacWright’s post came across as a\nconcerned insider rather than an outside detractor that even got the React folk thinking\n(and yes, there’s a world of difference between the two).\nI’d wager that if React is under question, the larger JS direction (React + webpack, built by\nNode.js) is under question by extension. Of course they aren’t the same thing, but nothing has come\nclose to React’s popularity and staying power for the web (especially when you factor in React\nNative and other targets). If React goes, there’s no clear replacement, which means further\nsplintering.\nIn rough chronological order, here are a few notable discussions/milestones that amount to some key\nplayers in tech all rethinking reliance in JS:\n\n2019: Web Components gain widespread browser support, and are basically standardized React\ncomponents, but devs don’t like them\n2019–2020: websites are over 2MB and getting bigger thanks to more JS\nApr 2020: a pretty damning study of JS frameworks comes out\nMay 2020: Tom Wright’s Second-guessing the modern web post\n\n🔗our tools are (still) fractured\nFrom time to time we all need to step outside our bubbles (JS, Rails, PHP, etc.) and be reminded\nthat the web development community is (still) fractured. HTML, CSS, and JS are inadequate in their\ncurrent form, so we turn to ellaborate tools to fill in their shortcomings.\nWe can’t simply write HTML, so we turn to template languages: Nunjucks, Jinja, Handlebars,\nPug, and Liquid, to name only a few (there are dozens and dozens I missed). But to compile these\nnon-standard templates, we need a compiler that’s likely built in Ruby, Node.js, Go, Python, or\nRust, depending on our choices (and the language used has sweeping consequences).\nOr perhaps you need to generate markup dynamically, in which case you’ll need a server. Again you’ll\nhave to pick a language (Ruby, Node.js, Go, PHP, Python, or Rust) as well as a framework (Rails,\nNest.js, Django, Laravel, Rocket, etc.). Your choice here will have further sweeping consequences.\nAnd then there’s writing JS, which may or may not get types (TypeScript), and which will likely be\nbuilt in a framework (Svelte, React, Vue, Angular, etc.). All of these choices will require setting\nup tooling (webpack / Rollup / Snowpack), as well as the connection to the server from your earlier\nchoices.\nBy now, we’ve been divided and subdivided and subdivided again by our choices. I want to be clear:\nI’m not at all advocating that we need to use one programming language for anything, or that\ndifferent problems need different solutions. But I am wondering why, if webpages are supposed to be\na standardized concept, there are so many splintered ways to assemble them that I fear we’re losing\nknowledge (and people) in between the gaps.\nThere shouldn’t be so many ways to do one standard thing.\n🔗where do we go from here?\nTo recap, I’m questioning current webdev practices because:\n\nwe might be back to a browser monopoly again\nall of us hate writing HTML/CSS/JS so much we invent new ways every year to avoid it\nReact + Node.js bundlers are cool but didn’t live up to promises\nour savior, web components, wasn’t received well (also worth mentioning it was championed by our\nChromium overlords so we’ll see if they ever do anything nice for us again)\n\nAll signs that cast doubt on our current direction. But even though the future is uncertain and\nthere’s no clear answer to how we solve all this, we can still make some intelligent bets.

To express my frustrations, I had written about half of a blog post under the title Media\nQueries are a Hack before I discovered that title had been taken. In 2013. Clearly I’m\nnot as original as I think I am.\nIan Storm Taylor, the author of that post, summarizes the major failing of media queries:\n\nI want write-once, use-anywhere—that’s what modular code is.\nMedia queries are not that. They’re write-everywhere. They’re relative to your screen, so\nevery time you write a media query for max-width or min-width, you’re connecting the appearance of\nyour module to the width of the entire canvas—exactly what you were trying to avoid.\n\nThis has only become more true and more of a problem in our React-influenced,\neverything-is-modular landscape of contemporary web design. And this lack of component-oriented\nthinking lead Ian to pine for what we all do—Container Queries.\n🔗container queries?\nIf, for example, I have a user card component that I want to rearrange when there’s not enough room,\nI can only do that based on the browser width, not the component width itself.\n\n  \n  What if I wanted to stack a card vertically not based on screen width, but based on whether or not the text and image will fit side-by-side? In 2020, I still can’t.\n\nContainer Queries seem to check off all the boxes:\n\n✅ Modular and composable\n✅ Attack the root problem of responsive design: resizing based on content\n✅ CSS-based\n\nBut perfect as they may be, Container Queries are not happening anytime soon. In Zach Leatherman’s\nrecent article The Origin Story of Container Queries, after much research, he even admits\nthe grim reality of our beloved Container Queries:\n\n[Container Queries] become almost cliché to mention it when talking about problems we’d like the\nweb platform to solve… Everyone wants it, but it sure seems like no one is actively working on it.\n\nSo what’s a person to do?\n🔗css grid repeat(auto-fit, minmax())?\nIf you’ve used CSS Grid, you may be familiar with this wonderful snippet:\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-gap: 1rem;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n}\n\nI was first introduced to this by Jen Simmons’ wonderful demo. With only 3 lines of CSS, we\nhave something that used to take hundreds:\n\nResponsive without any media queries\nGutters built-in 😍\nAnd last, but most importantly, items that resize based on their width (kinda sounds like\nContainer Queries, don’t it?)\n\nBut despite being incredibly-useful, CSS Grid’s repeat(auto-fit, minmax()) has 2 major drawbacks:\n\n🚫 It can’t be used on the component level like a Container Query could, so components can’t\ndeclare their own widths and breakpoints; their parents must.\n🚫 It doesn’t allow for columns of different widths. Neither can you tell items to responsively\nspan multiple columns without media queries (and if we’re using media queries we’re all the way\nback to where we started).\n\n🔗container queries.\nIt’s really hard to make a better pitch than Container Queries as a solution to the problem of\nmodular responsive design, after 7 years and hundreds of great minds have all shared their\ncollective vision of how this holy-grail-of-a-CSS-selector should work. There are no downsides to\nContainer Queries, other than the belabored point that they don’t exist.\nSo in parting, as I alluded to earlier, I will leave you, dear reader, with nary an original\nthought, instead, rehashing my favorite line from Phillip Walton’s well-referenced Responsive\nComponents: A Solution to the Container Queries Problem:\n\nWhile I think we’d all agree a pure CSS solution is the ultimate goal, I hope we as a community\nare able prevent the perfect from becoming the enemy of the good.\nIn matters like this, I like to remind myself of this quote from the W3C’s HTML design\nprinciples: “In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over\nspecifiers over theoretical purity.”\n\nIn other words, in 2020, the best solution we have to media queries’ failings is JavaScript.\nBut not JavaScript for the sake of JavaScript; JavaScript for the sake of users.\nIt’s been 7 years since Ian Storm Taylor published Media Queries are a Hack. And unfortunately, in\n2020, they’re still a hack. And we’re still waiting on Container Queries.\nI may not have any original ideas on this subject, but at least we’re all on the same page.\n🔗more reading\n\nMedia Queries are a Hack (the real one)\nResponsive Components: A Solution to the Container Queries Problem\nLet’s Not Forget About Container Queries\nThe Origin Story of Container Queries\n\n","id":"https://pow.rs/blog/media-queries-are-still-a-hack/","title":"media queries are (still) a hack"},"https://pow.rs/blog/playfulness-budget/":{"body":"All of us can recall being frustrated by a website or app, as well as inspired and entertained.\nSometimes both happen in the same app, either at different points in the journey, or if we revisit\nin a a different state of mind. Application design walks a tightrope between utility and whimsy. An\napp must use usable, drawing from familiar patterns. But if everything is copy-and-pasted from\nelsewhere the experience will be forgettable. However, if everything reinvents the wheel you’ve\ncreated a frustrating experience that users are lost in (fine for an experiential art exhibit;\nterrible for an app). How do you find a balance?\nI’ve always imagined this problem as having an imaginary bank or budget of “playfulness points” to\ndraw from. If you don’t spend any points, the experience at best ends up flat and dull; at worst\nbeing a waste of users’ time. But going deep into debt trying to be too whimsical and novel (a\ntendency that both novice and ego-driven designers have) is worse as it’s practically unusable. I’ve\ntried to distill things I’ve learned over the years into 4 tips to spend that “budget” wisely.\n🔗1. spend playfulness points during slow tasks\nEvery user when using your application will be in varying states of panic.\nBooking a hotel, tickets for a show, or flight? These can feel rushed, sometimes intentionally,\nand even feature anxiety-inducing timers, BOOK NOW! calls to action, and the impending sense that\nsomeone will snag this before you do (23 people have looked at this Airbnb in the last hour).\nThis is not a good time to test the user’s patience with playfulness.\nHowever, based on the task, state of mind, and precise point in the process a user finds themself,\nthere can be opportunities to slow down and deliver something unexpected.\n\n  \n  The Domino’s Pizza Tracker: probably my favorite example of a playful time-passer\n\nThe Domino’s Pizza Tracker is a legendary UX experience that gets everything right. It’s a fun,\nanimated tool that appends at the end of a user’s task, almost like the after-credits scenes in a\nMarvel movie where it’s optional to stick around. What better way to kill a 30-minute wait for a\npizza to arrive than stare at the pizza tracker’s wfun themes, creative animations, voice acting,\nand music?\nNow imagine what that experience would be like while you’re trying to order the pizza, with kids\nscreaming and no time to spare. One experience is a lot of fun; the other, not so much. And context\nis the only difference.\n🔗2. spend playfulness points during frustrating tasks\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Little Known Goods Carousel animation\n\nTwo pain points are the bane of my online shopping experience: image carousels and zoom views\n(usually which are baked into the same component). I find it unwieldy on particular devices—usually\nit‘s built with largely mobile or desktop in mind at the expense of the other. Further, the actions\naren’t always clear, with hover, click, and manual zoom yielding wildly different outcomes depending\non the site you’re on.\nFor a recent ecommerce site I built, I wanted to break the paradigm people were used to with\ncarousels so they put no prior expectations on it (save for the arrow keys). Using the metaphor of a\nfolding roadmap, I created a carousel that animates folding and unfolding as you click through the\nslides. For the zoom view, hover reveals a larger image, while on mobile the zoom is disabled and\nusers intuitively pinch-zoom to enhance (with all positioning JS disabled so your image doesn’t fly\noff into space while pinch-zooming).\nWhile you can be the judge on how well I did, the intent was to deliver a component that people\nhadn’t seen before—a 3D, folded carousel—in order to not have expectations be placed upon it. And in\ninjecting a bit of whimsy, hopefully it saves most visitors from a bad carousel experience by\nturning it on its head and making it playful.\n🔗3. spend playfulness points on first impressions\n\n  \n    \n  \n  A 3D, rotatable portable game console right at the top of the page? Yes, please.\n\nA user’s first several seconds on a site is a critical time for them. They’re orienting to the\nsite—to the layout, colors, language, etc.—while also having something they want to accomplish.\nWhile often times this is a winding path for the user to clarify what they want while orienting\nthemselves to a new interface, that first few seconds that a user suspends judgment can be just the\nright moment for playfulness.\nGreeting a user, for instance, with a fun animation on page load doesn’t disrupt their task while\nthey figure out where it is they need to go.\nGranted, there are good and bad types of animation. A good animation would simply be adding motion\nto the hero graphic, where a bad animation would be hiding the top menu and animating in items\none-by-one so the user has to wait painfully to even start their task. But assuming you executed the\nformer, setting an impression for playfulness right off the bat can pay dividends later.\n🔗4. spend playfulness points during successes\nErrors are frustrating. Messages like Oops! Something went wrong! can be flippant and tone-deaf,\nespecially when it resulted in data loss. Believe it or not, that was an actual error message I\nencountered that left me unable to pay a bill! Oops!? More like “Oops! I accidentally cancelled\nyour horrible service!”\nIn light of so many failures we encounter on the web, successes are something that should be\ncelebrated! 🎉 Did a user finish sending an email? Add a fun illustration and some congratulatory\ncopy on that succes page! Has a user reached a certain milestone in your app (miles walked,\nachievement reached, numbers hit)? Add a cool badge to their profile.\nUnexpected rewards may result in the most positively-perceived experiences. So let’s try and help\nthe humans that use our application feel appreciated because they’re worth it.\n🔗so how big is my “playfulness budget?”\nThe natural question after reading all this is—”how much can I spend?” “How far is too far?” You\nprobably saw this coming: it depends.\nJust like our personal relationships, sometimes a loved one reaching out to talk can be a\nlife-saver; other times a burden because you just really don’t have the time right now. In app\ndesign, “moments of delight” can either be a joy or a nightmare depending on the mindset of the\nuser, the “panic level” they’re feeling, and what you’re offering them.\nWhen we’re dealing with people, too much efficiency can be boring and detrimental to the squishy\nhumans you’re guiding. Sometimes the straightest roads can have us feeling sleepy behind the wheel a\nbit. Sometimes the little detours, the fun little dips and curves, make the journey memorable.\n","id":"https://pow.rs/blog/playfulness-budget/","title":"4 tips for setting a playfulness budget"},"https://pow.rs/blog/responsive-type-scales-in-css/":{"body":"Are you making typography on the web harder on yourself than it needs to be?

Yes. Yes, this is for you. If you type words and put them on\nthe internet, you should use this. You can check the “FAQ”&nbsp;section at the end to learn how it works\nwith special edge cases and such.\n🔗part 1: responsive type scales\n🔗getting started\nTypographic scales are a Goldilocks solution\nto font sizes. We don’t want too many font sizes in our site, but we need just enough to have the\ndesign look good and have structural hierarchy. We need just the right amount.\nIf you’ve ever used “shirt size” names like font-s, font-m, and font-l (small, medium, and\nlarge, respectively), you’ve likely run into the “too few” end of the spectrum (unless you resort to\ndumb names like font-xxxxl). But the real problem with this approach is this isn’t responsive\n(unless you resort to even dumber names like class=\"font-xxxl font-lg-xxxxl\").\nA responsive type scale solves all of the above: gives you just the right amount (it’s\nconfigurable, so you can set the right number you need), and handles responsive font sizes\nelegantly.\nBut before we get ahead of ourselves, you’re probably wondering “how does it look in action?” (or\nyou just want to copy + paste something and then leave). Let’s dive into an example first to show it\nin practice, then we’ll step back to explain the principles and reasoning. After all, no matter how\nsolid a concept is theoretically, will you use it if it has bad DX? Rest assured this is quick to\nlearn, easy to use, and solves your font problems.\nTo get started, copy some CSS classes into your styles (don’t worry; we’ll explain how we generated\nthese numbers later):\n\n/* fonts.css */\n/* (note: ignore the em values for now and only focus on the class names) */\n\n\n\n.font-u18 { font-size: 11.390625em }\n.font-u17 { font-size: 9.950627481136905em }\n.font-u16 { font-size: 8.692673779389363em }\n.font-u15 { font-size: 7.59375em }\n.font-u14 { font-size: 6.63375165409127em }\n.font-u13 { font-size: 5.795115852926242em }\n.font-u12 { font-size: 5.0625em }\n.font-u11 { font-size: 4.422501102727513em;}\n.font-u10 { font-size: 3.8634105686174953em }\n.font-u9  { font-size: 3.375em }\n.font-u8  { font-size: 2.9483340684850083em }\n.font-u7  { font-size: 2.575607045744997em }\n.font-u6  { font-size: 2.25em }\n.font-u5  { font-size: 1.9655560456566725em }\n.font-u4  { font-size: 1.7170713638299977em }\n.font-u3  { font-size: 1.5em }\n.font-u2  { font-size: 1.3103706971044482em }\n.font-u1  { font-size: 1.1447142425533319em }\n.font-d1  { font-size: 0.8735804647362989em }\n.font-d2  { font-size: 0.7631428283688879em }\n.font-d3  { font-size: 0.6666666666666666em }\n.font-d4  { font-size: 0.5823869764908659em }\n.font-d5  { font-size: 0.5087618855792586em }\n.font-d6  { font-size: 0.4444444444444444em }\n.font-d7  { font-size: 0.3882579843272439em }\n.font-d8  { font-size: 0.3391745903861724em }\n.font-d9  { font-size: 0.2962962962962963em }\n.font-d10 { font-size: 0.2588386562181626em }\n.font-d11 { font-size: 0.22611639359078162em }\n.font-d12 { font-size: 0.19753086419753085em }\n.font-d13 { font-size: 0.17255910414544176em }\n.font-d14 { font-size: 0.15074426239385438em }\n.font-d15 { font-size: 0.13168724279835392em }\n.font-d16 { font-size: 0.11503940276362785em }\n.font-d17 { font-size: 0.10049617492923625em }\n.font-d18 { font-size: 0.0877914951989026em }\n\nDon’t want to use CSS classes? You could use\nCSS variables or\nJS values or even Sass\nvariables—it is universal after all and you can translate this into whatever works best\nThen just sprinkle the utilities in whenever you need it:\n&lt;h1 class=\"font-u6\"&gt;I’m an h1 so I’m 6 steps up from the base size&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=\"font-u5\"&gt;\n  I’m an h2 so I’m slightly smaller than h1, but still 5 steps up from the base\n  size\n&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;small class=\"font-d1\"&gt;I’m 1 step down from the base size&lt;/small&gt;\n\nWhat if that h1 tag needs to be a little bigger? No problem; bump it up one to font-u7. Or\nsmaller: font-u5. They’re just numbers; you go up (font-u*) or down (font-d*) as you need to.\n🔗nesting\nSince we’re dealing with ems, we can nest sizes. Say we had an &lt;h1&gt; tag we wanted to be big, but\ninside that we have a subheading we want to be the same size as the base font. How would we\naccomplish that? Easy:\n&lt;h1 class=\"font-u3\"&gt;\n  I’m 3 steps up from the base size\n  &lt;small class=\"font-d3\"&gt;I’m the same size as the base (3 - 3)&lt;/small&gt;\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n\nBy thinking in terms of moving “up” or “down” a scale, you’re starting to think in relationships,\nwhich is how type works. Typography is less about absolute sizes, and is more about how much bigger\nor smaller one size is to another (how one “relates” to another).\nBut if this nests, won’t this be a pain to keep track of when you’re several components deep? If\nyou’re working in components, it’s probably smart to reset the font size back to 1rem (root font\nsize) so sizes within a component are predictable:\n.MyComponent {\n  font-size: 1rem; /* reset font size back to base */\n}\n\nThis may seem like an annoyance at first if you haven’t done this before, but this is actually great\npractice. This will be an important principle for responsive sizes going forward.\n🔗responsive sizes\nResponsive font sizes can be a nightmare at scale. Fortunately, using this system, you only have\nto set a component’s base sizes for each breakpoint. But to add this, let’s copy the the same CSS\nvalues from above, but this time we’ll use CSS variables and swap out the ems for rems:\n/* fonts.css (expanded from above) */\n\n:root {\n  --font-u18r: 11.390625rem; /* the “r” in “u18r” stands for “root” */\n  --font-u17r: 9.950627481136905rem;\n  --font-u16r: 8.692673779389363rem;\n  --font-u15r: 7.59375rem;\n  /* … (add the rest from above) */\n}\n\nThen in your component styles, you only need to change the base size for its breakpoints:\n.MyComponent {\n  font-size: var(--font-d1r); /* small screens: 1 step down */\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n  .MyComponent {\n    font-size: 1rem; /* medium screens: base size */\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1200px) {\n  .MyComponent {\n    font-size: var(--font-u1r); /* large screens: 1 step up */\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1800px) {\n  .MyComponent {\n    font-size: var(--font-u2r); /* extra large screens: 2 steps up */\n  }\n}\n\nYou don’t have to do anything else! Because we’re using ems, our components all scaled while\npreserving their typographic relationships. However, for the base component size, we did use rems\ninstead of ems to blow away any nested styles we may have had to deal with otherwise\n(following good principles of layout isolation).\n🔗further reading\nCongratulations! You’ve just learned the whole system. 🎉 From here you may want to explore the\nfollowing:\n\nresponsive-typography contains all the code\nabove but packaged in a convenient npm wrapper\nCodeSandbox example\nshowing how responsive type scales can work in an app\n\nBut perhaps even after seeing how it works, you have some lingering “why” questions. Such as: how\nbig is a “step” in pixels? or what if I don’t like the scale above? or is this really simpler\nthan other typographic libraries? Read on to get a little more into why this approach can work for\neveryone.\n🔗part 2: why responsive type scales work\nNote: this section is completely optional to read—you have everything you need to start using a\nresponsive type scale already. Everything that follows is theory and extra information if you’d like\nto understand the concepts a bit deeper.\n🔗3 principles of a type scale\n\n  \n  The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (try saying that 5 times fast) is a stunning Renaissance-era example of flawless typography. And like all printed material, it uses a typographic scale to achieve its beauty.\n\nAs we mentioned above, typographic scales solve the Goldilocks problem of font sizes: you need just\nenough to make the design feel complete, but not too many.\nTypographic scales are so effective because they’ve had time to mature. At over 600 years old,\nthey’re as ancient as the printing press itself (they don’t look a day over 500 though). You’ve\nencountered typographic scales every time you’ve used a word processor like Google Docs. While\nyou’ll find some slight variation from program to program, most typographic scales are identical\nsave for a few numbers. And they have three guiding principles that are important to keep in mind:\nthey scale exponentially, are expressed in steps, and prioritize relative sizing over\nabsolute.\n🔗principle 1: exponential scaling\nThe classic type scale you know from almost every word processor is:\n6   7   8   9   10   11   12   14   16   18   21   24   30   36   48   60   72\n\nLet’s look at the scale increase between the numbers:\n6   7   8   9   10   11   12   14   16   18   21   24   30   36   48   60   72\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  1   1   1   1    1    1    2    2    2    3    3    6    6    12   12   12\n\nNotice how the numbers increase exponentially moving up the scale (it’s not a\nmathematically-perfect exponential equation, but it still exponentially increases at regular\nintervals):\n                   |\n                +--+\n                |\n                |\n                |\n                |\n                |\n             +--+\n             |\n             |\n          +--+\n      +---+\n------+\n\nThe reason for this is that bigger font sizes require bigger increases for contrast. You can\nprobably recognize the difference between 6px and 7px type because that’s a 16.6% increase in\nsize. But you can’t tell the difference between 71px and 72px (1%). So 6 -&gt; 7 make sense as a\ntypographic relationship, but not 71 -&gt; 72.\nAny type scale we make has to scale exponentially, which means we can mathematically automate it!\nYay!\n🔗principle 2: type scales are expressed in steps\nGiven type scales’ exponential nature, it would follow that we treat them like exponents. For\nexample, when we’re dealing with powers of 2, how do we express it? Not as 2, 4, 8, 16… but as\n2² 2³ 2⁴ …. Let’s apply that thinking to the type scale: we’ll take the same scale, but number the\nsteps themselves. And we’ll give the step itself a number (step² step³ step⁴ …):\n6   7   8   9   10   11   12   14   16   18   21   24   30   36   48   60   72\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1   2   3   4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17\n\nThinking in numbered steps lets you remove all the complexity of conditional logic. You don’t have\nto go “OK so I’m at 24px, which means the next step up is +6 but the next step down is -3.”\nYou simply think in terms of being at a certain step and going up or down.\nIn the end, your new scale is just a list of integers, which is much simpler to reason about (this\nis only the bottom row from above):\n1   2   3   4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17\n\nAnother way to think about this idea is to treat it the same way you would a music scale. You don’t\nsay “first I’ll play a 440 Hz note followed by 493.8833 Hz.” You simply say “I’ll play an A\nnote, followed by B.” “A” and “B” are just shorthand names for the tones produced that are easier to\nreason about. In the same way, you don’t have to remember that 9 was 16px; you just know that\nyour font size is a 9 on the scale.\n🔗principle 3: relationships matter\nTake a look at the following type samples:\n\n  \n    A\n    Heading\n    Paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph\n    Footnote\n  \n  \n    B\n    Heading\n    Paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph\n    Footnote\n  \n\nWhat if I told you that the “paragraph” size from Column B was the same value as the “heading” in\nColumn A? Inspect it if you don’t believe me! Our brains don’t perceive absolute value as much as we\nthink we do. Take this famous optical illusion from Edward H. Adelson:\n\n  \n  Are “A” and “B” really the same color? (Yes)\n\nThe tiles marked “A” and “B” are the exact same RGB value. Our brains perceive one as lighter than\nthe other because of their relationships— “B” is surrounded by darker colors, and “A” by lighter\ncolors. The illusion works because our brains are hardwired to perceive relative differences (if\nyou’re interested in this general subject, see Interaction of Color by Josef Albers).\nManaging a typographic system is the same in that the relative sizes are more important than\nabsolute sizes. Something isn’t a heading because “headings are 32px and that’s the law.”\nBecause as soon as your base size increases to 32px, headings have to be proportionately bigger to\nmatch! No, headings are only headings if they’re noticably larger than normal text.\nSo how do we deal with relationships? We know that a type scale is expressed in steps already, but\nnow we have to think in relative steps from one size to another. Taking the scale we had before,\nlet’s slide the bottom numbers to center around our base font size—16px—to measure how far away\nother numbers are, relatively:\n6   7   8   9   10   11   12   14   16   18   21   24   30   36   48   60   72\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-8 -7  -6  -5   -4   -3   -2   -1    0   +1   +2   +3   +4   +5   +6   +7   +8\n\nWe can easily see that 16 -&gt; 18 is +1 step; 16 -&gt; 30 is +4 steps; 16 -&gt; 9 is -4 steps,\netc. If we move around the scale even more, we notice more interesting relationships. 16 -&gt; 30 is\nthe same “ratio” as 30 -&gt; 72. In both cases, there are 4 steps in between.\nSo now we start to get back to those font-u4 CSS classes introduced earlier. See how no matter\nwhat our base size started with, all that matters is applying the correct number of steps up or\ndown? If we just know that we want a heading to be 4 steps above our base size, it gets a\n&lt;h1 class=\"font-u4\"&gt; class. And if we resize everything else on the page, that typographic\nrelationship is preserved. That means less code to write, and less code to manage.\nIt takes some work, and relearning, to remap how you’ve thought about font sizes on the web. But\nyou’ll be amazed at how much simpler things become when you do.\n🔗building your own scale\nSay you are getting the basics of the system, but that exact scale ratio just isn’t working for your\nfonts. This is the basic mathematical formula used, of which full credit goes to\nSpencer Mortensen:\n𝐹 ^ (𝑛 / 𝛥)\n\nYou have 2 basic settings to configure: 𝐹, the factor for multiplication, and 𝛥, the delta\n(distance) between each step. Say you wanted to increase font size 2.25× every 6 steps (my\npersonal favorite scale). That would look like this:\n2.25 ^ (𝑛 / 6)\n\nThe last variable, 𝑛, receives the step number you’re calculating. This is how the example back at\nthe beginning of the blog post was generated—by counting up (1, 2, 3, …):\n2.25 ^ (1/6)      -&gt;    1.1447142426\n2.25 ^ (2/6)      -&gt;    1.3103706971\n2.25 ^ (3/6)      -&gt;    1.5\n2.25 ^ (4/6)      -&gt;    1.7170713638\n2.25 ^ (5/6)      -&gt;    1.9655560457\n2.25 ^ (6/6)      -&gt;    2.25\n…\n\nTo go down the scale, use negative numbers (-1, -2, -3, …):\n2.25 ^ (-1/6)     -&gt;    0.8735804647\n2.25 ^ (-2/6)     -&gt;    0.7631428284\n2.25 ^ (-3/6)     -&gt;    0.6666666667\n2.25 ^ (-4/6)     -&gt;    0.5823869765\n2.25 ^ (-5/6)     -&gt;    0.5087618856\n2.25 ^ (-6/6)     -&gt;    0.4444444444\n…\n\nTip: want to calculate these a bit more automatically? Try\nthis visual calculator or see the scale() method in JS\nin\nresponsive-typography\nTake the above values and plug them into CSS class names, CSS variables, Sass variables, JS\nvariables… whatever your system uses. It’s universal because at the end of the day it’s just ems.\nNow that you know how these numbers are made, you may find that the 2.25:6 scale isn’t producing\nthe results you expected. Try playing with both numbers\nand seeing what you get. Try it in an existing app! The key is experimentation.\nThat wraps up the main meat of the blog posts. What follows from here are tips and FAQs to try and\ntake care of remaining questions.\n🔗appendix 1: faq\n🔗how does this compare to x, y, or z?\nEver since the idea of responsive design came about, we’ve been inventing complex systems to manage\ntypography (or we’ve been ignoring it and hoping the problem goes away 🙈). There are too many to\nlist out here, but prominent ones I’ve come across:\n\nFlexible Typography with CSS Locks:\nthis is probably the closest to a technically-accurate system, but just look at this\n“human-generated” CSS for a single font size:\nline-height: calc(1.3em + (1.5 - 1.3) * ((100vw - 21em)/(35 - 21))). Does your brain work like\nthis? Mine doesn’t.\nTailwind CSS: here’s their simple example:\n&lt;p class=\"text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl ...\"&gt;. Imagine managing all\nthat manually across all your markup? No thank you.\nTypography.js: This requires a runtime? I’d rather\nnot have flickering font sizes as my pages load, thank you.\nMaterial UI: Decent type scale, but not\nresponsive.\n\nIn short, other proposals have come about, but they’re either too complicated for human-written CSS.\nOr they require a JS runtime for styling, which by default won’t work in a large number of setups.\nI’d argue that responsive type scales strikes the best balance of simplicity and efficiency, and it\nworks in every setup.\n🔗how can I use this with multiple fonts?\nWhen working with multiple fonts, sometimes one scale to “rule them all” will work just fine. But a\ncommon problem is having different fonts appear bigger or smaller than another at the same pixel\nsize. In that case, you’ll need an adjustment number. Say your site has 2 fonts: one for body, and\nanother for headings. Say your heading font is feeling a little small when you try and use the same\nscale for everything:\n\n/* fonts.css */\n\n:root {\n  /* your base scale */\n  --font-u6: 2.25em;\n  --font-u5: 1.9655560456566725em;\n  --font-u4: 1.7170713638299977em;\n  --font-u3: 1.5em;\n  --font-u2: 1.3103706971044482em;\n  --font-u1: 1.1447142425533319em;\n\n  /* heading scale */\n  --heading-adjustment: 1.5px; /* Increase the final size of the heading font */\n}\n\n.font-heading-u6 { font-size: calc(var(--font-u6) + var(--heading-adjustment)) }\n.font-heading-u5 { font-size: calc(var(--font-u5) + var(--heading-adjustment)) }\n.font-heading-u4 { font-size: calc(var(--font-u4) + var(--heading-adjustment)) }\n.font-heading-u3 { font-size: calc(var(--font-u3) + var(--heading-adjustment)) }\n.font-heading-u2 { font-size: calc(var(--font-u2) + var(--heading-adjustment)) }\n.font-heading-u1 { font-size: calc(var(--font-u1) + var(--heading-adjustment)) }\n\nWe have a --heading-adjustment CSS variable that we’re using to modify the final output value.\nIt’s being calculated at the end, so we are still using the same scale, but we can make a minor\nvisual tweak to make the typefaces work together better. Simply adjust --heading-adjustment to\ntaste. Rinse and repeat for any other typefaces you add to your project.\n🔗can i use this in CSS-in-JS?\nYes (try the\nJS import from responsive-typography).\n🔗appendix 2: tips\nSome various tips you may find helpful both in adopting responsive type scales, and thinking about\nit in the context of your larger styling system.\n\nIf you’re struggling, try working backwards from pixels. Say you’re trying to generate your\nown type scale, but you just can’t find the right factor and delta that feels right. Try\nstarting with an absolute type scale like 12px 14px 16px 18px 21px …, and work backwards into\nthe relative type scale. Use the visual calculator and\nlook on the right hand side. How close can you get to recreating your absolute scale? Now you have\nmore of a concrete goal to hit than simply turning dials until something “feels right.”\nHardcode the scale if you can help it. It might be tempting to write a Sass or JS function to\ngenerate the scale values. While there’s nothing wrong with that, know that if you change your\nscale, you change your design. All the hard work and perfectly-tuned styles have now just gone\nout the window. I like to not have this “typographic restart button” so easily-accessible on a\nteam that may not understand the implications.\nRename the CSS classes to whatever you like. You may not like font-u1 or font-d1. Generate\nyour own scale and come up with your own names! Keep\nit short and sweet, but do what’s obvious to you.\nWhy not both—use CSS AND CSS-in-JS! It doesn’t hurt to use CSS utility classes AND CSS\nvariables AND JS values in your CSS-in-JS. Sometimes you just want a global CSS class; other times\nyou need a value in your scoped CSS Modules. There’s no right or wrong here; simply do what saves\nyou and your team the most time, both in writing new code and managing existing code.\nReset component styles at the base level. This is a good practice beyond this blog post! You\nalways want your component’s styles to be\nisolated from one another, which means\nthrowing some resets at the top level. When your components only look good in certain contexts but\nnot others, you’re fighting a losing battle.\nAvoid global breakpoints if you can help it. Often people try and have a\nperfect breakpoint system\nin their app. It makes sense—it’s simple, and it’s encouraged in frameworks. But it’s bad because\nglobal breakpoints don’t care about your actual content. They don’t care that half of your\ncomponents look weird as the page responds. Conversely, component-level media queries are always\nperfect for every component. It’s a little extra code, sure, but it’s 100% scalable, and unlike\nglobal breakpoints, adjusting one component’s breakpoint will never disrupt another. A little\nredundancy can save a lot of headache down the line. Give it a try and prove me wrong!\n\nIf this post was helpful, please\ngive responsive-typography a star on GitHub (or\ngive me feedback in the issues!)\n","id":"https://pow.rs/blog/responsive-type-scales-in-css/","title":"responsive type scales: the correct way to handle font sizes in css"},"https://pow.rs/blog/the-state-of-es-modules-in-2020/":{"body":"In 2019, a revolution happened in JS. You may have missed it. All major browsers\nand Node.js added native support for ES Modules (ESM)—no Babel, transpiling,\npreprocessing, or trickery needed.\nIf you’ve written JavaScript in the time before React &amp; webpack, you remember how much of a mess it\nwas without import or require(). You had to be intimately familiar with this and lexical\nscoping, otherwise it’d come back to bite you. All JS having global scope (even vendor scripts) was\nhard to do well, which often meant you limited its reach. JavaScript was maligned in other\nprogramming communities for the things it lacked compared to more mature languages, chiefly of all,\na module system.\nThat changed in 2019, when the ESM proposal became a reality, not something that only lived in the\nmake-believe world of webpack &amp; Babel. JavaScript finally got the thing everyone had been asking\nfor.\nSo why didn’t more people notice?\n🔗the land of make-believe\nIn preparing for a talk I gave last year, I realized just how much JS has changed over\nthe last decade. Node.js was released in 2010 with the CommonJS module system, and as a result, npm.\nThat’s over 10 years of CommonJS we’ve been writing, and we’re not slowing down there (if this is\nall mumbo-jumbo to you, hopefully my talk will help).\nIn the land of Node, we got Gulp, Grunt, Babel, webpack, Browserify, and Rollup. These are all tools\nthat fundamentally changed how we wrote JS. And they all, in their own unique ways, compensated for\nJS’ lack of a module system. Gulp and Grunt gave you more tools to invent your own bundle, whereas\nBrowserify and webpack embraced the idea of a JS module system by completely simulating it, and\nabstracting it away from you. Babel made everything possible.\nBut the point is: all of these tools over the past 10 years created a land of make-believe that JS\nitself (or browsers) didn’t support. This wasn’t a bad thing, as it let us code more, faster, and we\ngot to stress-test the future before actually arriving—all good things.\nBut now we don’t need it anymore, and it’s hard to change everything and start over again. And\nperhaps that fear of starting over—again—has kept us from recognizing the exciting new future. Yet\nwe must move forward.\n🔗why switch to ESM\nSo, why switch to ESM? What do we stand to gain by changing everything?\n🔗universal JS\nThe same JavaScript you write for the browser, works in the server. While that was the promise of\nNode.js, over time it’s shifted away from ECMAScript to become its own language. ESM would bring\neverything back under one roof again.\n🔗remote imports\nThis is huge. We can import any module from anywhere on the internet, and are no longer bound to\nnpm. Consider Deno, a new V8/Rust/Tokio runtime that might replace Node.js. This is a line\nfrom the docs:\n\nComparison to Node.js Deno does not use npm\n\nThis single, understated line is a huge shift. How can you just… move away from the most popular\npackage repository in history? Well thanks to ESM, you can load modules from any URL, whether that\nbe locally, or a CDN. npm install is now no longer needed; the language itself supports\ncross-domain modules!\n🔗no bundling or transpilation needed\nImagine a world where you don’t need to run any CLI command whatsoever to start a front-end\napplication. No runtime, webpack, build times… nothing.\nTo learn more about this, check out A future without webpack.\n🔗near-perfect caching\nIn the webpack world before ESM, you had to make trade-offs: rolling everything into one giant\nbundle meant no load times after initializing, but that initial download is brutal. Conversely,\n“code splitting” into tiny chunks made each chunk easily-downloadable but code is almost certainly\nduplicated across those chunks and a user will be paying for the same weight over and over again (🤔\nnot entirely unlike buying a home with cash or paying it off over 30 years, now that I think about\nit).\nWith ESM, the entire dependency tree is exposed to the browser, so the browser can perfectly cache\nwhat it needs, and nothing more (imagine if you paid nothing on your home to start, zero interest\never, and you only paid for the parts of the home you used, as you used them). Of course, cache\ninvalidation is a separate problem that will be with us until the end of time. But that aside, ESM\ntruly is the perfect caching story for JS.\n🔗making the switch\nSo let’s say you’re sold on ESM… how do you make the leap? Well, it may be your tools that are to\nblame:\n\nReact: doesn’t ship an ESM-ready package (as of Mar 2020)\nnpm: &lt; 8% of npm packages ship ESM (as of Oct 2019)\nNode.js: though it supports ESM, it’s not in a stable LTS release yet (as of Nov\n2019)\nwebpack: can’t ship your code as ESM, nor can it take advantage of ESM features like remote\nimports.\n\nBy choosing these tools even in new projects, you’re shipping legacy code that already has a limited\nlifespan. But some of that isn’t within your control, sure—maybe your company, or client demands\nthese. Or you just can’t accomplish what you need to with alternatives; that’s understandable.\nBut there are also some new, exciting projects on the horizon that are shaping up to replace\nnow-legacy CommonJS tools:\n🔗Snowpack\nSnowpack (a play on ”no pack”) is an install tool (disclosure: that I’m one of the lead\ncontributers for) that lets you ship ESM-ready code straight to the browser\nand use npm. You can npm install like normal, and lets you use Preact, Vue, Svelte, and more\nbut with zero build time and no configuration.\nsnowpack.dev\n🔗Pika CDN\nPika Registry does all the work of finding ESM-ready packages for you. Search for\nany keyword like you would on npm, except Pika Registry can tell you instantly whether or not that\npackage supports ESM.\npika.dev/registry\n🔗Deno\nDeno is a new competitor to Node.js, built with V8, Rust, and Tokio and features native\nTypeScript and ESM support out-of-the-box. Its guiding principle is to more closely mirror\nECMAScript in the areas where Node departed, principally only allowing ESM rather than CommonJS.\nThough the project is in beta, it’s already gathering community attention and shows tons of promise.\ndeno.land\nTo recap, the current state of ESM in 2020 is: it’s ready to use everywhere, but it’s up to\nyou to opt-in! Give some of the new ESM tools a try, and you might find yourself dealing with less\ntooling, less configuration, and other great benefits while helping the community at large unify\naround ESM.\n","id":"https://pow.rs/blog/the-state-of-es-modules-in-2020/","title":"JavaScript's greatest revolution was too quiet"},"https://pow.rs/blog/was-html-a-mistake/":{"body":"OK, hear me out. Even if Betteridge is right and the answer at the end of this blog\npost ends up being “no,” let’s treat the question “was HTML a mistake?” purely as a thought\nexperiment. And it may shed light on some of the more frustrating parts of making websites.\n🔗why was HTML created?\nTim Berners Lee’s “WorldWideWeb” browser editor (1993) source\nTim Berners Lee open-sourced the first browser in 1993 as a WYSIWYG editor. So basically\nan internet-connected Microsoft Word.\n…that’s it. That’s why it was invented. To share docs with other people online. You thought there\nwas going to be more history to it? No; it’s not that old.\nNow we’ll fast-forward a few years. Please explain to me how the fuck you might accomplish\nsomething like this in a WYSIWYG editor:\n\n  \n    \n  \n  The actual homepage of rino-pelle.com. An actual work of animation art that people actually made, somehow.\n\nIf your answer is “that looks hard to do,” you are absolutely correct. It’s hard trying to trick\nHTML a.k.a. “Microsoft Word Online” into doing something this awesome.\nI, too, bemoan the fact that the average website today weighs 2 MB. And it’s easy\nto blame JavaScript, or images, or whatever for that weight. But we’re fooling ourselves if we think\nwe can achieve 👆 in under 2 MB with our current tools (Rino &amp; Pelle, since you’re wondering, is\n1.87 MB gzipped, unpacking to 2.07 MB—pretty close to average, wouldn’t ya say?).\nIf the weight of the average website comes from lobbing enough JS at the DOM until we trick it into\nanimating, we have 2 paths forward to solve this: either we ditch the JS frameworks and revert the\nweb into mostly static documents like The Good Lee intended. Or we don’t use HTML &amp; JS and serve\nsomething compiled instead.\n🔗if not HTML, then what?\nOnce upon a time, long before Apple made decisions about the internet, Flash existed. And\nit was great. Flash was the defacto way you made cool, rich, interactive experiences. It not only\ndelivered futuristic, fun, imaginative, and creative interfaces, it did so on a budget, back in the\ndays of dial-up. On computers that had way less memory and resources than our phones do now.\n\n  \n  The 2Advanced site in 2001, the gold standard for cutting-edge web design at the time\n\nI’m not saying that Flash itself was the pinnacle of what the web could be, no. There were reasons\nfor its demise, and it did compromise a core principle of the web: openness (it not only had\ncritical security issues; it was proprietary technology owned by a private corporation and thus not\na web standard). Still, you have to give Flash credit for giving us the the most imaginative\ninterfaces we’ve ever seen outside of sci-fi films.\nI’ll summarize our journey up to this point in a few true, albeit conflicting, statements:\n\nHTML was invented primarily for text documents\nHTML was not designed to be highly-interactive\nFull rendering control is best done in a compiled native application, like Flash or a\nvideo&nbsp;game\nCompiled applications are closed-source experiences that violate key principles of the\ninternet’s open, safe design.\n\nSo how do we reconcile this—how do we have our cake and eat it too?\n🔗…HTML5 canvas?\nHTML5 canvas is a pretty-darn smart spec. It leverages CPU &amp; GPU efficiently for\nrendering, has an OK-ish footprint, and keeps the source open. Mind you, it’ll never replace\nnative code, but it’s essentially the correct answer to all the above problems—it lets us deliver\nrich, interactive experiences for the web without compromising security or openness.\nBut to our earlier point, canvas isn’t typically smaller than HTML, so that’s a dead-end\nalready. Even if it makes animating &amp; rendering easier and more fun, it’s still JavaScript, except\nyou have to build your rendering tools from scratch compared to HTML + CSS.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  Zoomquilt, the greatest Flash experiment ever made, was revived in HTML5 canvas form!Full disclosure: I know this isn’t 100% relevant to this post, but when am I going to get another opportunity to reminisce about Zoomquilt?\n\nBut let’s assume (thought experiment) there was a way to render crazy-awesome experiences with\ncanvas, and it was faster, lighter, and better all-around than HTML. We still couldn’t switch to a\ncanvas-dominated internet because it’s not screen reader-friendly (unless you use HTML as a\nbase and overlay canvas on top). That would mean most of the internet would be\nunreachable to people with visual impairments. Just how many sites is that?\n🔗what is the web now? what will it be?\nFor as many statistical reports as I read, like “the average weight of websites” and “your users are\nall using mobile phones” and “video is the way to market” (debunked, BTW), I can’t\nremember reading a report that summarized breakdown of the internet by industry.\nAs of Apr 2020, there are an estimated 1.7 billion websites (Internet Live Stats) online.\nAssuming that’s true…\n\nIf there are 600 million blogs (most of which are on\nTumblr), that would mean blogs make up 35% of websites (this is moving fast—only 65% to\ngo!).\nThanks to monopolistic mergers and acquisitions, there are only a handful of popular social media\nsites, so that’s only, like, what? 10? 15?\nThere are also a countable number of video/entertainment websites that serve online content, too\n(probably about 100 or so, counting the naughty stuff)… but we’re still probably at 35%\n(shoot; what are the rest?).\nIf 64% of small businesses have a website, and there are…&nbsp;uh… hm. I have no idea how\nmany businesses there are on Earth. At least 1%–65% of websites according to my estimates.\nIf WordPress powers 35% of all websites, and WordPress sites mean blogs, editorial sites,\nand business sites… wait that overlaps with “blogs” above doesn’t it? Crap.\n\nI honestly have no idea what the internet is made up of 🤷‍♂️, but we can make some sweeping\ngeneralizations.\nGoing by quantity (sheer number of websites), I would guess it’s mostly blogs + brochure websites\n(businesses, restaurants, etc.). The vast majority of these are text-based (HTML).\nWhen it comes to bandwidth, the data seems to point toward video content (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)\nAnd video doesn’t apply to our current convo.\nWhen it comes to users’ time spent online, a good amount is spent on the major social networking\nsites like Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. And that’s a mixture of video and text.\nSo all that to say, while it’s hard (impossible?) to give an accurate number of the web that must be\nscreen-reader friendly, and thus text-based, it’s safe to say “most.” And if screen reader support\nis essential for most of the internet, HTML is still the best foundation we have.\n🔗…so Betteridge was right, then? HTML wasn’t a mistake?\nLately I’ve been spending more time with compiled languages (like Rust—which was used to make this\nblog!) and loving them. And I wish we could make the internet more efficient by compiling more (I\nknow WebAssembly exists, but that’s not going to replace the DOM). Maybe the love affair the\ninternet had with its biggest compiled language to-date, Flash, had its heyday and it’s time to move\non. Maybe canvas is neat, but shouldn’t upend HTML as the lingua franca of the web.\nMaybe there’s something better on the horizon—but I don’t know what, or how it’ll give us everything\nHTML, CSS, and JS does in a smaller package—but maybe we can serve the same creative, accessible\ninternet in under 2 MB per page.\nUntil then, HTML appears to still be the best delivery method for serving text-based content.\nBut it doesn’t mean I have to enjoy animating it. And you can bet your bippy if I don’t need screen\nreader support I’m going to be doing some fun stuff in canvas.\n","id":"https://pow.rs/blog/was-html-a-mistake/","title":"was HTML a mistake?"}},"docInfo":{"https://pow.rs/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://pow.rs/about/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://pow.rs/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://pow.rs/blog/3-pillars-of-front-end-knowledge/":{"body":1374,"title":4},"https://pow.rs/blog/did-we-fuck-up-the-internet-pt-1/":{"body":614,"title":5},"https://pow.rs/blog/media-queries-are-still-a-hack/":{"body":444,"title":4},"https://pow.rs/blog/playfulness-budget/":{"body":645,"title":5},"https://pow.rs/blog/responsive-type-scales-in-css/":{"body":2361,"title":9},"https://pow.rs/blog/the-state-of-es-modules-in-2020/":{"body":646,"title":4},"https://pow.rs/blog/was-html-a-mistake/":{"body":755,"title":2}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};
