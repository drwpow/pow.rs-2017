I frequently get asked how to get a job in coding. Either because that person is genuinely
interested in tech, or just because they hate their job and [capitalism sucks][r-antiwork]. Either
way, I believe anyone can learn to code, and make a lot of money doing it. But the best part is it’s
actually fun!

There’s never been a better time to learn coding than today in 2021 because [the job market is hot
and heating up][job-security]. If you want to learn how to code, I’ll do my best to share everything
I’ve learned in these job posts.

## “who are you?”

My name is Drew Powers, and I’ve been making websites professionally for almost 15 years. I won’t
bore you with the details such as accidentally falling into web after failing as an artist and
musician. But it’s important to know that I’ve achieved a successful career in tech with the
following credentials:

- no college degree in computer science
- no bootcamps
- entirely self-taught
- built first paid websites as side-gigs while working at a low-paying job

Despite no formal credentials or training, I’ve been lucky enough to achieve the following:

- Attended [TC39][tc39] meetings to help give input on the future of JavaScript
- Core contributor to award-winning OSS like [Snowpack][snowpack]
- Have been recognized by engineers from Google, npm, Cloudflare, and more
- Consulted on technology decisions for businesses big and small
- I make a good salary for my area ($160k in Denver, CO)

I believe you can do all this too. And there’s no secret, no stupid PDF download (seriously stop
clicking on those—you know they’re all scams by now, right?). The only trick is just wading through
all the noise and figuring out where to start.

## “is tech for me?”

I’ve prepared a brief personality quiz to gauge your potential interest in learning to code. Answer
each question `1`–`4`, with `1` being “strongly disagree” and `4` being “strongly agree.”

| Question                                    |                1                 |                2                 |                3                 |                4                 |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| I love using my mind                        | <input type="radio" name="s1-1"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-1"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-1"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-1"> |
| I enjoy working quietly by myself sometimes | <input type="radio" name="s1-2"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-2"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-2"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-2"> |
| I enjoy being part of a team                | <input type="radio" name="s1-3"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-3"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-3"> | <input type="radio" name="s1-3"> |

Add up your scores:

- `5`–`9`: Meh. You don’t know you won’t like it till you try!
- `10`–`14`: You’ll probably really like coding.
- `15`+: Why aren’t you in tech already!?

OK, OK—you caught me. That was a biased quiz, and I’m trying to trick you into coding. But I believe
**coding is for everyone because coding is not an industry.** Now that [every company is a tech
company][tech-company], you can code in order to help out veterinarians, artists, finance,
hospitality, or, heck, even the marijuana industry. Whatever your life’s passions are, they need
technology to do it, and you can have job security and high pay without giving up what you care
about. Remember: at the end of the day, you still [write code that impacts
people][code-is-political].

## “should i go to bootcamp or not?”

This is a quick deviation, because we haven’t even covered _what program_ you’d enroll in bootcamp
for, but I think the question is generally addressable.

I got started in tech before bootcamps existed. But I’ve hired people that came straight from a
bootcamp. I found bootcamp gradautes generally well-prepared for the job and set up for success,
much moreso than fresh college graduates (though I will admit mileage varies by the university and
program). I would say I’m generally _in favor_ of attending a bootcamp, but that still leaves the
choice of whether it’s right for you.

The argument **in favor** of bootcamp is that you learn exactly what you need to know at an
accelerated timescale. You’ll get ramped up faster in a bootcamp, and spend less time preparing for
that first job in coding. Of course, it will cost money, but is significantly cheaper than college,
and because your salary will steadily increase ([assuming you job hop][job-hopping]), bootcamp ends
up paying for itself very quickly.

The argument **for being self-taught** is that you’ll be front-loading the hard part. Self-teaching
is absolutely a skill, and it’s crucial to a coding career. It’s a skill that many bootcamp
attendees may struggle with after graduating. The people that learn how to teach themselves early
are unstoppable, and generally accelerate pretty quickly.

Networking is a moot point. Some act like bootcamps boost your network, but I disagree generally.
Professional networks for coding exist largely on [meetup.com][meetup], [Reddit
circles][r-learnprogramming], and local Slack/Discord groups, and are all free to tap into. All I’ve
seen the bootcamps do is just force the attendees to get plugged in there anyway.

Arguably the biggest decision maker, other than money, is self-discipline. Bootcamps are typically 3
months. In order to teach yourself you’d have to commit the same amount of time—several hours each
day—in addition to building just as many projects as the bootcamp would require. It’s harder than it
seems at first glance! While I think people _can_ teach themselves in 3 months, I’ve also known
people to take a year or more, just because life gets in the way. So if you’re on a timecrunch,
strongly consider bootcamp. If not, then you could always give it a try on your own, and fall back
on bootcamp if you struggle.

## “i want to get started, but where do i fit in?”

Brass tacks: the rest of this part 1 blog post will try and draw circles around the largest
meta-groups of coding careers. These are all just made up by me, based on what I’ve encountered in
my own experiences and observed in the industry at large. So according to me there are 4 major
groups of coders that are all **potential starting points** for you, young padawan:

| Type          | Agencies | Startups | Big Corps |                             Key Languages                             |     Other Skills     |
| :------------ | :------: | :------: | :-------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
| **native**    |    ✓     |    ✓     |     ✓     | C#, C++, C, Cocoa, Java, JavaScript, Swift, Objective-C, Visual Basic |                      |
| **web**       |    ✓     |    ✓     |     ✓     |        Elixir, Go, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, SQL        |                      |
| **analytics** |          |    ✓     |     ✓     |                         Python, R, Scala, SQL                         | calculus, statistics |
| **game dev**  |    ✓     |          |     ✓     |                               C++, Java                               |       physics        |

_Disclaimer: this is a beginner blog post, so I’m glossing over lots of nuance here (such as
omitting dozens of other types of developers and dozens of sub-groups and hundreds of programming
languages). I’m only attempting to provide a very simple view of development to a non-coder._

To start, I’d recommend starting down one of these 4 paths. But since I have only worked in web,
from here on I’ll argue **why you should pursue web development** as your starting point since I can
represent that position. But in reality, I’m just trying to help you find your starting point. I’ll
try my best to give an honest assessment of each.

Also keep in mind that all groups have a universal pro: all are highly-paid jobs (great!), and a
universal con: all groups [suck at not being overrun by white males][diversity] (ick!).

### web: what it is and why it’s so great

Web is anything that’s online. Typically you may think of websites, but it also encompasses
everything connected to the internet, including but not limited to social media, email, online
gaming, cloud storage, online financial transactions, and more. If the internet is involved in any
way, then it depends on the core discipline of web (we’ll explore all the web skills later). Web is
all about people connecting online, just like you’re doing now reading this blog post! The infinite
creativity and possibilities of the internet—whatever we want to make that into—begin and end with
web skills.

### game dev vs web

Most readers will have a general idea of what video games are, so I don’t need to explain to you
what video game coding entails. At its best, you’ll get to leave a legacy of video games for people
to experience, which are a [diverse story-telling medium][dragon]. At its worst, you might be
dealing with an environment that’s not only highly-competitive, but also potentially
[sexist][activision] and [toxic][ubisoft] (if you work for one of the larger employers).

Web’s biggest advantage over game dev is job demand. If you’re let go as a web dev with average
experience, you have hundreds of fallbacks. Worst case scenario: you wind up at a company that’s
just “meh.” If you’re let go as a game dev, unless you are absolutely exemplary, it may be a while
before your next gig. A second advantage of web is more bite-sized projects. Get a bad web project?
Just wait for the next one in a couple weeks. Get a bad project as a game dev? Sorry; we’re going to
need the next 2 years of your life (at least) to get this out.

⚠️ **potential starting point:** [game dev][unity]

### analytics vs web

You may not have heard of [Data Analytics][data-analytics] or a Data Scientist before as a career,
but you’d be forgiven as it’s a newer profession. It sits at the intersection of math and
programming, and involves taking huge data sets and building programs to crunch the data to reach
insights. For example, imagine all the millions of people that buy something off Amazon each day. If
you could look through all those purchases at once, you’d probably find that a particular dress is
in fashion this season. Or that a particular brand of TV outsells the rest. It would be too much
data for your human eyeballs to look through it manually; you’d have to build a program to fetch it
all and analyze it the way you wanted to. As a data analyst you can learn insightful and powerful
truths about the world around you through datasets.

Web has an easier barrier to entry, requiring you to only learn how to code. Data Analytics requires
statistics, calculus, and coding, which is a lot starting from scratch. Subjectively, if you
consider yourself a creative person, you may find data analytics suffocating. But if not, and you
love math, then give Data Analytics a shot! Compared to web they are both in-demand, and both
high-paying jobs.

⚠️ **potential starting point:** [data analytics][data-science]

### native vs web

Native developers develop code for a specific platform, e.g. Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac. In a
certain sense, native development is the “original” form of coding, back before the internet
existed. And it’s still needed today because every operating system requires different code to run
apps properly. If a native developer writes code for a mobile platform, they may have a chance to
cross over into game dev, too.

To me, the difference between native and web is somewhat arbitrary. Both careers are valuable for
any size company across all industries. Both have high pay. Both have fantastic job demand. I still
separated them as different “groups” because they typically practice different day-to-day skills and
write code in different languages from one another.

This may seem like a cop-out, but if you’ve made it this far I’d **suggest skipping native at first
and continuing with web.** But come back to native if developing for a specific platform or piece of
hardware really, really speaks to you.

⚠️ **potential starting point**: [learn Android][android] / [learn iOS/Mac][ios] / [learn
Windows][windows]

## making the choice

Your first step—and your homework for part 1—is to pick one of the four groups above and stick to
it.

Imagine learning to code is like trying to get access to a big, circular building, with exterior
doors on all sides. You have to get to the center of the building. You open a door, look inside, and
you see a hallway. A long, long hallway. So long you can’t see the end. It gets to the center
_eventually_, you figure, but what if the next door is a shorter path? So you walk a little bit, and
open the next door, same. Next door, same. Next door, same. All you see is that long hallway again,
and none seem clearly closer to the center. You grow tired and frustrated.

I have a comforting thought and a hard thought. The hard thought is what you feared: **learning to
code will take dedicated time to complete.** For some, that may be a couple months if they spend
hours each day. For others, they may do it off-and-on for a year. There’s no wrong way to do it, so
long as you’re being kind to yourself and doing it your way. But the comforting thought? The door
you pick doesn’t matter. You’re going to end up at that center of coding either way. And the
quickest path to the center is just picking _a_ door and walking. You’re never getting closer just
running around the edges.

If you **didn’t want to learn code for web**, scroll back up to one of the potential starting points
and get started! Hopefully this served as the kick you needed to start down your path.

If you **DO want to learn code for web** (my recommendation for those unsure), I won’t leave you
hanging here. Come back for part 2 soon, which will cover the web careers frontend engineer vs
backend engineer, as well as which web language you should learn in 2021. See you then!
